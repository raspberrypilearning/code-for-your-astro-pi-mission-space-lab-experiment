Here are a few Raspberry Pi projects to whet your appetite:

- For a Life In Space experiment, a great resource is the [Life In Space pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/life-in-space). This includes projects to help you [get started with the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/3), [collect data](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-data-logger/4), and [design your experiment](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/experiment-design/3).
- For a Life On Earth experiment, there is a [separate pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/life-on-earth) that includes projects to help you [use the camera](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/6) and even [calculate the speed of the ISS using computer vision](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-iss-speed/5).
- NDVI experiments will find the [NDVI project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-ndvi) very helpful.
- Machine learning experiments will find the [image classification project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/image-id-coral) an excellent guide to get rolling.

In addition to these projects, there are many other useful and interesting tutorials and guides available on the internet:

- The [Coral example projects](https://coral.ai/examples/) and the [Coral camera examples](https://github.com/google-coral/examples-camera) give a good overview of what's possible with the Coral ML accelerator.
- The [OpenCV Python tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) explain how to do all sorts of cool things like machine learning, edge detection, and object tracking.
- The [EarthPy examples gallery](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/index.html) walks you through how to process satellite imagery, including for calculating NDVI.
- This [GitHub page](https://github.com/orbitalindex/awesome-space) contains a curated list of space-related resources.
- This [list of annotated satellite datasets](https://github.com/Seyed-Ali-Ahmadi/Awesome_Satellite_Benchmark_Datasets) can be used to train your machine learning model.
- Teams wanting a greater challenge will find a comprehensive resource on aerial and satellite machine learning [here](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#datasets) â€” be warned that it is quite advanced.

Finally, don't forget that links to the documentation for each library are available in the [Kit OS section](2) if you need specific information on how to use a particular library.
