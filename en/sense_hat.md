### Limitations of the sensors

Be aware of the limitations of the sensors and the [constraints imposed by them](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/experiment-design/1). In particular, be mindful that the temperature and humidity sensors are affected more by the temperature of the CPU than anything else. If you wish to take readings of the ISS environment, you should test the temperature and humidity readings in a controlled (known) environment and come up with a strategy to compensate for this limitation.
