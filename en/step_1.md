## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to turn your Phase 1 experiment idea into a real experiment that can be run on your own Astro Pi hardware and on the International Space Station (ISS)!

### What you will make

You will build your very own Astro Pi and write a Python program to gather data to support or reject your experiment hypotheses. You will learn how to test your program to give it the best chance of running successfully aboard the International Space Station (ISS)!

### What you will learn

By reading this guide you will learn:
* how to build an Astro Pi and how to use it
* how to write a Python program that meets the constraints imposed from working on the ISS. In particular, you'll learn about which Python libraries are available aboard the ISS, as well as some common Python use-cases including:
  * how to run your program for 3 hours
  * how to find the location of the ISS
  * how to save data captured from the sensors and the camera
* You will also learn about the various restrictions placed on programs running aboard the ISS, and how best to navigate them.

## Guidelines & Pre-Submission Checklist

In order to have your program run aboard the ISS it's really important that you read the [guidelines on the Astro Pi website](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines) and that you look over the [Phase 2 program checklist](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/program-checklist) before submitting your work. Bear in mind that there are some differences in what you are allowed to do depending on if your experiment theme is "Life On Earth" or a "Life In Space".

This guide is designed so that it can also be read by young people. In particular,
each of the "How to" pattern sections could be used as an activity for your young people.
