### Attaching the Sense Hat

Let's start by assembling the Sense HAT.
![Animation of the Sense Hat assembly](images/animated_sense_hat.gif){: style="max-width: 50%;" }

--- task ---
Find the Sense HAT and the small bag that comes with it that includes some screws and spacers, as well as a regular GPIO header.

Remove any stickers on the top of the Sense HAT.

![Photo of the Sense HAT with small header removed.](images/assembly_small_header.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Take the black hexagonal spacer columns from the small bag that comes with the Sense HAT. Use the accompanying screws to connect them to the bottom of the Raspberry Pi 4.

![Photo of the Raspberry Pi 4 with attached HAT spacers.](images/assembly_spacers.JPG)
--- /task ---

<div class="pir_step">

--- task ---
In a separate bag, locate the tall GPIO header. We will use this header instead of the regular header to allow enough space for the PIR sensor.

![Photo of the tall GPIO header](images/tall_header_pins.png)
--- /task ---

</div>

--- task ---
Line up the header with the corresponding holes on the bottom of the Sense HAT.  

<div class="pir_step">
![Photo of tall header lined up with the Sense HAT.](images/assembly_insert_header.JPG)
</div>

<div class="not_pir_step">
![Photo of regular header lined up with the Sense HAT.](images/back_sense_hat_regular_header.jpg)
</div>
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Push the header all the way through, making sure none of the pins are obstructed and that they are lined up correctly so that they do not become bent.  

<div class="pir_step">
![Photo of tall header inserted through the Sense HAT.](images/assembly_sh_header.JPG)

![Photo of the camera ribbon cable inserted through the gap in the Sense HAT](images/ribbon_cable_inside_sense_hat.png)

With the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera and connector cable unboxed, take the connector cable and feed it through the gap in the Sense HAT. The silver side of the connector cable should face the LED matrix and not the blue side.

Here is a video of the process:

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Find the CSI (Camera Serial Interface) port on the Raspberry Pi and gently pull the edges of the port's plastic cap.
![Diagram showing the location of the Camera Serial Interface on a Raspberry Pi 4](images/pi4-camera-port-vector.png)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
![Animation of a part of the camera install process](images/connect-camera.gif){: style="max-width: 80%" }
Insert the camera ribbon cable into the Raspberry Pi CSI socket, making sure that the silver side (and not the blue side) is facing the LED matrix. There should be 1 or 2mm of silver still remaining when the cable has been put in correctly.
Then, push the plastic clip back into place.

--- /task ---

</div>

--- task ---
Place the Sense HAT onto the Raspberry Pi and ensure the 40 GPIO pins line up with the corresponding holes in the header.

![Photo of a Sense HAT fitted on to a Raspberry Pi device with a tall header and camera cable passed through the slot on the HAT.](images/assembly_cam_spacers_sh.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Use the four remaining black screws to secure the Sense HAT stack to the spacers. 

![Photo of the Sense HAT with screws securing it to the spacers.](images/assembly_spacer_top.JPG)
--- /task ---

You've finished putting the Sense HAT on. On to the next step.

<div class="pir_step">

### Passive infrared (PIR) sensor

--- task ---
Take the PIR and remove the foam pin protector block. 

![Photo of PIR with foam pin protector block removed.](images/assembly_PIR.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Take a moment to familiarise yourself with the [layout of the Raspberry Pi pins](https://pinout.xyz). Notice that the odd-numbered pins are on the left-hand side, the even-numbered pins are on the right-hand side, and that the pin number increases by 2 each time we go down a row. 

![Diagram of the Raspberry Pi headers](images/rpi4-headers-vector.png)

Take a moment to look at the PIR sensor. Do you see the labels GND, VCC, and OUT?

![Photo of PIR with wires attached to pins.](images/assembly_PIR_wires.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now we are going to connect each pin on the PIR sensor to an appropriate pin on the Raspberry Pi using the three F-F jumper wires provided in the kit.

![Diagram of the PIR wiring](images/pir_wiring-vector.png)

- Connect the VCC pin on the PIR sensor to pin 1 (3V3) on the Raspberry Pi
- Connect the GND pin on the PIR sensor to pin 6 (GND) on the Raspberry Pi
- Connect the OUT pin on the PIR sensor to pin 32 (GPIO 12)

**Note**: Your jumper wires may be a different colour to the ones in the photos.

![Photo of a Raspberry Pi with wires from the PIR connected to the correct pins.](images/assembly_wires.JPG)

Here is a video of the PIR setup:

### Converting the camera to use infrared

If your Life on Earth experiment requires an infrared-sensitive (IR-sensitive) camera â€” for example, you are doing a NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) experiment â€” then you will need to convert your camera using the steps below.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #fa1111; background-color: #f56c6c; padding: 10px;">
**Note**: If you are programming a Life in Space experiment, or your Life on Earth experiment requires photos to be taken in the visible light spectrum only, then please don't convert your high-quality camera sensor as you can't reverse/undo it later.
</p>

title: How does the infrared camera work?
---
The high-quality camera sensor can detect infrared (IR) light. However, the sensor housing contains an IR filter, which is used to greatly reduce the cameraâ€™s sensitivity to IR light.  This is so that the images captured by the high-quality camera sensor look the same as what we see with our eyes (which are not sensitive to IR light). By removing this filter, we allow the IR light to pass through along with visible light.

In the next steps we will replace the built-in filter with a separate red filter which allows only reflected red light (660nm) and reflected near-infrared light (850nm) through to the sensor.  See our [NDVI project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-ndvi) for more information. 

--- /collapse ---

--- task ---
Remove the built-in infrared filter from the high-quality camera by following the [instructions here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/accessories/camera.html#raspberry-pi-hq-camera-filter-removal). You will need to use the 1.5mm Allen key.

To help you even more, here is a video of this process:

--- task ---
 
Take the MIDOPT filter and sit it onto the hole in the centre of the high-quality camera sensor.

![Photo of the high-quality camera sensor with the red filter sitting on top prior to installation.](images/filter_rest.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
 
Gently start turning the filter clockwise using just your fingers, so that the filter screws down into the high-quality camera sensor. Take care not to touch the glass part of the lens and leave greasy fingerprints.

![Photo of the high-quality camera sensor with the red filter being turned by hand.](images/filter_fingers.JPG)

--- /task ---

--- task ---
![Photo of the MIDOPT filter adjustment tool supplied with the MIDOPT filter](images/midopt_filter_tool.jpg){: style="max-width: 50%" }
 
Take the tool provided with the filter and line up the two knobbly bits at each end with the corresponding dimples in the filter. If you have a 3D printer, you might like to [print a handle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tinkercad.com/things/31aXmXN5y1a?sharecode%3DzKyKeuZOfRedhVhzYGubLbc-m-ffZl-uq_EGv07lS9M&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1668524338706246&usg=AOvVaw2rUbx_xg6m_2a4R2SkQ4_K) for the tool to make it easier to grip. One of these handles has been printed and sent to the ISS for the astronauts to use when completing the task â€” but it isn't required. 

![Photo of the high-quality camera sensor showing the filter tool aligned with the filter itself.](images/filter_tool_align.JPG)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
 
Continue gently turning the filter using the tool. Take care not to touch the glass part of the lens with the tool â€” it will scratch it.

![Photo of the high-quality camera sensor with the red filter being turned using the tool.](images/filter_tool.JPG)

--- /task ---

--- task ---
 
You should start to feel increasing resistance as the filter gets lower. After about nine full turns, the filter should be as low as it can go and you won't be able to turn it any further. Be careful not to over-tighten. 

![Photo of the high-quality camera sensor with the red filter being turned using the tool.](images/filter_turning.JPG)
